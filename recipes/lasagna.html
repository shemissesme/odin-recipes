    <p>Prepare this easy lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 olive oil, plus a little for the dish</li>
        <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
        <li>a little grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g pack fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>white sauce</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</p>
        <h4>Step 8</h4>
            <p>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</p>
        <h4>Step 9</h4>
            <p>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</p>
