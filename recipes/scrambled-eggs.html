    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large free range eggs</li>
            <li>6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk</li>
            <li>a knob of butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</p>
